## Why Vulcan-O1?

Large Language Models excel at symbolic reasoning but fundamentally lack **physical grounding** and **structural cognition**.
VULCAN-O1 introduces a **structure-first intelligence paradigm**, where intelligence emerges from **morphology, physics, and iterative self-evolution**, rather than pure token prediction.

**Pipeline**  
SGLang → Blender Physics → Iterative DPO → Morphological Optimization → Game Transfer

## Core Innovations

### Morphological Reasoning
Emergent mechanical intelligence through structure optimization.

### Sim-to-Game Transfer
Zero-shot structural transfer into game environments.

### OFT Optimized
Orthogonal Fine-Tuning for structure-preserving learning (致敬刘老师).

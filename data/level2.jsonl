Apply a simulated load of 600 kg (as a downward force or mass property) to the remaining deck segments combined. Verification: The bridge must support the 600 kg load without structural failure (e.g., no significant deformation or collapse) for at least 100 frames under gravity simulation.", "verification": "The bridge must support the 600 kg load without structural failure (e.g., no significant deformation or collapse) for at least 100 frames under gravity simulation."}
{"id": 328, "task_id": "vertical_frame_spiral_bracing", "instruction": "Task: Construct a vertical frame structure with spiral bracing to support a load of 1300 kg. Structure: Build a central vertical column using a cube with dimensions 1x1x16 meters (width x depth x height), positioned at (0,0,0) with its base at ground level (Z=0). Add spiral bracing by creating four diagonal support beams, each as a cube with dimensions 0.2x0.2x4 meters, arranged in a helical pattern around the central column. Position the first beam from (0.5,0,0) to (0,0.5,4), the second from (0,0.5,4) to (-0.5,0,8), the third from (-0.5,0,8) to (0,-0.5,12), and the fourth from (0,-0.5,12) to (0.5,0,16), ensuring they wrap around the column in a spiral. Assembly: Attach all bracing beams to the central column using FIXED Constraints at their connection points to ensure structural integrity. Apply a simulated load of 1300 kg at the top of the column by adding a small cube (size 0.5x0.5x0.5) at (0,0,16) and setting its mass property accordingly. Verification: The frame must remain stable under the load, with no visible deformation or collapse, when simulated for 100 frames in Blender's physics environment.", "verification": "The vertical frame with spiral bracing must support the 1300 kg load without structural failure, maintaining its shape and position for at least 100 frames in simulation."}
{"id": 329, "task_id": "cantilever_truss_variable_stiffness", "instruction": "Task: Construct a cantilever truss structure with variable member stiffness to support a load. Structure: Create a horizontal cantilever truss extending 6 meters along the X-axis from a fixed support at the origin (0,0,0). The truss consists of a top chord (size 6x0.1x0.1), a bottom chord (size 6x0.1x0.1) positioned 0.5 meters below the top chord, and vertical and diagonal members connecting them. Use cubes for all members. Assembly: Attach the truss to a fixed base at (0,0,0) using FIXED Constraints. Connect the top and bottom chords with vertical members at 1-meter intervals and diagonal members in alternating directions between chords. Set variable stiffness by adjusting the material properties of members: assign higher stiffness (e.g., density 5000 kg/m³) to members near the fixed end and lower stiffness (e.g., density 1000 kg/m³) to members near the free end. Actuation: Apply a downward load of 450 kg (converted to force: 450 * 9.81 = 4414.5 N) at the free end of the top chord (at X=6, Y=0, Z=0.5). Verification: The truss must support the load without structural failure, with maximum deflection at the free end not exceeding 0.1 meters under static conditions.", "verification": "The cantilever truss must withstand a 450 kg load at the free end with variable stiffness, ensuring deflection does not exceed 0.1 meters and no member fails."}
